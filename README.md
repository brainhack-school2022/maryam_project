# About
My background is in physics, and I graduated in Cognitive Psychology.
For my master thesis, I designed an experiment to investigate whether people change their perceptual choices in the light of others' decisions.
Ideally, I like to understand and explain via a computational approach what happens in a psychiatric disorders or neuro related diseases.
I enjoy nature a lot, also running, traveling and doing yoga.
